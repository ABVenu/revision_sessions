## 🔹 **Variables & Declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`)**

---

### ✅ **Single-Line / Theory Questions**

1. What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in terms of scope?
2. Can a `const` variable be reassigned? Can its object properties be changed?
3. What is redeclaration? Which keyword allows it?
4. What happens when you declare a variable without any keyword?
5. What is the default value of an uninitialized `let` variable?
6. What does it mean that JavaScript is loosely typed?
7. Why is it not recommended to use `var` in modern JS?
8. What’s the difference between declaring a variable and initializing it?
9. Can `const` be declared without assigning a value?
10. What happens when you assign a value to a variable without declaring it?

### ✅ **Guess the Output**

11.

```js
console.log(x);
var x = 5;
```

> Output: `undefined` (due to hoisting)

---

12.

```js
console.log(y);
let y = 10;
```

> Output: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization`

---

13.

```js
var a = 1;
var a = 2;
console.log(a);
```

> Output: `2` (Redeclaration allowed with `var`)

---

14.

```js
let x = 10;
x = 20;
console.log(x);
```

> Output: `20` (Reassignment allowed with `let`)

---

15.

```js
const user = { name: "Alice" };
user.name = "Bob";
console.log(user.name);
```

> Output: `Bob` (Object properties can be mutated)

---

16.

```js
const a;
a = 5;
console.log(a);
```

> Output: ❌ SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

---

17.

```js
a = 100;
console.log(a);
```

> Output: `100`, but `a` becomes a global variable (bad practice)

---

18.

```js
function test() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20;
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x);
}
test();
```

> Output: `20`, `20` (Function scoped)

---

19.

```js
function test() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20;
    console.log(x);
  }
  console.log(x);
}
test();
```

> Output: `20`, `10` (Block scoped)

---

20.

```js
console.log(typeof undeclaredVar);
```

> Output: `'undefined'`

---

21.

```js
{
  var a = 10;
}
console.log(a);
```

> Output: `10` (var is function scoped, not block scoped)

---

22.

```js
{
  let b = 20;
}
console.log(b);
```

> ❌ `ReferenceError: b is not defined`

---

### ✅ **Coding Tasks**

23. Declare a variable with your name and log it to the console.
24. Create a constant object `person` and modify one of its properties.
25. Write a program that uses `let` inside a loop and shows correct scoping.
26. Show an example where `var` causes unintended overwriting due to scoping.
27. Write a function where you attempt to reassign a `const` variable and handle the error.

### ✅ **Tricky/Advanced**

28.

```js
const obj = Object.freeze({ name: "John" });
obj.name = "Doe";
console.log(obj.name);
```

> Output: `John` (Frozen object cannot be mutated)

---

29.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);
console.log(arr);
```

> Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (Mutating array contents is allowed)

---

30.

```js
function demo() {
  console.log(a);
  var a = 5;
}
demo();
```

> Output: `undefined`

---

31.

```js
function demo() {
  console.log(a);
  let a = 5;
}
demo();
```

> ❌ `ReferenceError`

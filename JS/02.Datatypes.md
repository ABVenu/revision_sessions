## 🔹 **Data Types (Primitive & Non-Primitive)**

---

### ✅ **Single-Line / Theory Questions**

1. What are the 7 primitive data types in JavaScript?
2. What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?
3. Is `typeof null` really `'object'`? Why?
4. How is `typeof` used, and what are its limitations?
5. What’s the output of `typeof NaN` and why?
6. What’s the difference between `undefined` and `null`?
7. Can functions be assigned to variables? What data type is a function?
8. What does `typeof typeof 5` return?
9. Are arrays and objects the same in JS?
10. What is the default value of an uninitialized variable?

### ✅ **Guess the Output**

11.

```js
console.log(typeof "hello");
```

> `'string'`

---

12.

```js
console.log(typeof 42);
```

> `'number'`

---

13.

```js
console.log(typeof true);
```

> `'boolean'`

---

14.

```js
console.log(typeof undefined);
```

> `'undefined'`

---

15.

```js
console.log(typeof null);
```

> `'object'` ❗ (quirk in JS)

---

16.

```js
console.log(typeof Symbol("sym"));
```

> `'symbol'`

---

17.

```js
console.log(typeof function () {});
```

> `'function'`

---

18.

```js
console.log(typeof NaN);
```

> `'number'` ❗

---

19.

```js
console.log(typeof []);
```

> `'object'` ❗ Arrays are objects in JS

---

20.

```js
console.log(typeof {});
```

> `'object'`

---

21.

```js
console.log(typeof new Date());
```

> `'object'`

---

22.

```js
console.log(typeof Infinity);
```

> `'number'`

---

23.

```js
console.log(typeof BigInt(123));
```

> `'bigint'`

---

24.

```js
console.log(typeof class MyClass {});
```

> `'function'`

---

### ✅ **Coding Snippets / Tasks**

25. Create variables for each primitive type and log their type.
26. Create an array and use `Array.isArray()` to check if it is an array.
27. Create a function and check its type.
28. Use `typeof` to detect if a variable is a string, number, or boolean.
29. Show a case where `typeof` gives misleading result.
30. Write a function that takes any value and logs its actual data type clearly (including array vs object).

### ✅ **Tricky/Corner Case**

31.

```js
console.log(typeof null === "null");
```

> `false` – because `typeof null` is `'object'`

---

32.

```js
console.log(typeof [] === "object");
```

> `true` – arrays are objects

---

33.

```js
console.log(Array.isArray([]));
```

> `true`

---

34.

```js
console.log(typeof new String("test"));
```

> `'object'` – String object, not primitive

---

35.

```js
const x = new Number(5);
console.log(typeof x);
```

> `'object'` – not primitive number

---

36.

```js
let val = undefined;
console.log(val == null);
console.log(val === null);
```

> `true`, `false`

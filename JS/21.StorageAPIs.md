### âœ… **Guess the Output**

21.

```js
localStorage.setItem("user", "Alex");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("user"));
```

> Output: `"Alex"`

---

22.

```js
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionId", 123);
console.log(typeof sessionStorage.getItem("sessionId"));
```

> Output: `"string"`

---

23.

```js
localStorage.setItem("data", JSON.stringify({ a: 1 }));
const value = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("data"));
console.log(value.a);
```

> Output: `1`

---

24.

```js
document.cookie = "token=123abc";
console.log(document.cookie.includes("token"));
```

> Output: `true`

---

25.

```js
document.cookie = "user=John; max-age=1";
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(document.cookie);
}, 2000);
```

> Output: Cookie likely expired; empty string or other cookies

### âœ… **Coding Snippet / Practical**

26. **Store a user object in localStorage**

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
```

---

27. **Retrieve and parse user object**

```js
const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
console.log(data.name);
```

---

28. **Check if key exists in localStorage**

```js
if (localStorage.getItem("token")) {
  console.log("Token available");
}
```

---

29. **Delete specific localStorage key**

```js
localStorage.removeItem("token");
```

---

30. **Clear everything from localStorage**

```js
localStorage.clear();
```

---

31. **Set sessionStorage item**

```js
sessionStorage.setItem("isLoggedIn", "true");
```

---

32. **Get all keys in localStorage**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
  console.log(localStorage.key(i));
}
```

---

33. **Create a cookie with expiry**

```js
document.cookie = "username=Bob; max-age=3600"; // 1 hour
```

---

34. **Read a specific cookie by name**

```js
function getCookie(name) {
  const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
  const found = cookies.find(row => row.startsWith(name + "="));
  return found ? found.split("=")[1] : null;
}
```

---

35. **Delete a cookie**

```js
document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC";
```

---

36. **Secure + HttpOnly cookies (server-side)**

> Canâ€™t be done via JS directly. Set via server:

```http
Set-Cookie: token=abc; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
```
